Welcome to my personal website!

Usually, people like to boast about themselves on their websites, but that's not really my style. Still, I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to explore my research, projects, hobbies, and more.

Here are some things about me:

I am a PhD student at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, researching in the field of machine learning applications in signal processing.

I currently work as a research assistant at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research and Development of Serbia, where I study the applications of artificial intelligence in computational biology.

In my free time, I enjoy road and mountain biking. I do most of my thinking on the trails, and that's where most of the research roadblocks get solved!
