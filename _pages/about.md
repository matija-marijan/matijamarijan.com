Welcome to my personal website!

Usually, people like to boast about themselves on their websites, but that's not really my style. Still, I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to explore my research, projects, hobbies, and more.

Here are some things about me:

I am a PhD student at the University of Belgrade, researching advanced AI/ML methods for audio signal processing, with focus on spatial audio, microphone array processing, sound source localization, and geometric deep learning.

I currently work as a research assistant at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence R&D of Serbia, where I develop AI/ML pipelines for computational biology, including drug development, molecular optimization, and protein engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy road and mountain biking. I do most of my thinking on the trails, and that's where most of the research roadblocks get solved!
