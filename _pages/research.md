## Computational biology

I am currently researching the many fascinating applications of machine learning algorithms in healthcare and life sciences, with a focus on computational biology. 

Specifically, my research interests in this field are:

* Drug-target interaction analysis and affinity prediction
* Directed and constrained molecular property optimization
* Protein function prediction and generative peptide optimization

## Signal processing

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where I am focusing on advancing the field of acoustic signal processing using machine learning methods.

## Computer vision

I am also interested in the many applications of advanced computer vision tools and methods. I have worked on several projects dealing with difficult image-based tasks. 

Here are some of them:

* Development of a thermal imaging camera trap for detecting small animals
* Machine learning-based surface crack detection on construction surfaces
* Automated 3D CT renal calculus and organ segmentation
* Sanitary freshener quality control automatization using computer vision
* Hemorrhagic lesion detection and segmentation on head CT scans
