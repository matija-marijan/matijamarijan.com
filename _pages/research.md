## Computational biology
---

My research in computational biology explores how machine learning can accelerate various tasks and solve complex problems in this field. I focus on developing AI/ML models, iterative pipelines and optimization frameworks for drug development, molecular design, and protein engineering. 

Current research projects include:

* Development and evaluation of drug--target affinity prediction models ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/PLM-GraphDTA))
* Directed and constrained molecular property optimization
* Peptide sequence optimization with a mixture-of-experts genetic algorithm ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/genetic-sequence-optimization))
* Protein function prediction and generative peptide optimization

## Signal processing

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where my research focuses on advancing acoustic signal processing through modern machine learning methods.

Here are some of the research topics I am working on:

* Developing advanced AI/ML techniques for spatial audio analysis and microphone array processing
* Sound source localization using message passing graph neural networks ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/Graph-RelNet)) ([Paper](/publication/2025-11-24-sound-source-localization))
* Geometric deep learning for modeling spatial relationships and learning geometry-aware representations

## Computer vision

I am also involved in research and development of computer vision methods for practical applications that span environmental monitoring, medical imaging, and industrial quality control.

Some of the projects I have work on:

* Development of a thermal imaging camera trap for detecting small animals ([GitHub](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/OCT-RODENT))
* Machine learning-based surface crack detection on construction surfaces ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/surface-crack-detection))
* Automated 3D CT renal calculus and organ segmentation ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/3D-Gastro-CT-Auto)) ([Paper](/publication/2023-6-23-automated-calculus-extraction))
* Sanitary freshener quality control automatization using computer vision ([GitHub](https://github.com/matija-marijan/freshener-quality-control))
* Hemorrhagic lesion detection and segmentation on head CT scans
