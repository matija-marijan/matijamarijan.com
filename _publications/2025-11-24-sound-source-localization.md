Sound source localization (SSL) is a fundamental
problem in audio signal processing. Traditional SSL approaches
often degrade in challenging acoustic conditions, while more
recent deep learning-based methods struggle to generalize to
unseen microphone arrays or to fully exploit the relationships
between microphones in an array. We propose Graph-RelNet,
a graph-based neural network that extends relation networks
with residual graph convolutional layers to regress the direc-
tion of arrival (DoA) from generalized cross-correlation with
phase transform (GCC-PHAT) features. Experiments on the
TIMIT speech corpus demonstrate that Graph-RelNet consis-
tently outperforms a regression-based adaptation of GNN-SSL,
while also surpassing conventional steered response power (SRP)
with delay-and-sum (D&S) beamforming at medium and high
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), especially in scenarios with few
microphones. At 5 microphones and SNR = 30 dB, Graph-RelNet
reduces mean absolute DoA error by up to 45%. The model also
shows strong generalization to unseen microphone arrays and
remains competitive under low-SNR conditions.
