This paper deals with the problem of automated
segmentation and structure analysis of musical pieces on the
basis of extracted features from audio recordings of the piece.
The complexity of musical piece segmentation problems is a
consequence of the multiple elements by which the segments
differ, and those can be melody, harmony, rhythm, and
timbre. Self-similarity matrices (SSM), based on selected
features are used as a cornerstone for segmentation. The
features used are MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients) and chroma features which follow changes in
timbre and harmonic structure. A self-similarity matrix
segmentation procedure based on straightforward methods for
morphological image processing is proposed. The Dynamic
Time Warping algorithm (DTW) was used as a tool for
evaluating the degree of similarity of the segments. The
proposed procedure was applied to 2 pieces of classical music.
