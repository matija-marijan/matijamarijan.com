Planning the optimal approach for performing percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (PCNL), minimally invasive surgery to remove
kidney stones, is critical to reducing the risk of surgical
complications. This paper presents the 3D Gastro CT Auto tool for
automatic three-dimensional (3D) segmentation and visualization of
renal structures with calculus using contrast-enhanced computerized
tomography (CT) scans. A novel algorithm for 3D segmentation
based on histogram analysis of preprocessed CT scans was
implemented as an upgrade of a previously developed
3D Gastro CT Extended application with the aim of simplifying its
use, reducing study processing times, and bringing the use of a
minimally invasive PCNL planning tool closer to clinical practice.
The results of using the tool are shown on the CT scan database of
eight patients.
